# Coding Interview Questions

A curated collection of coding challenges.

Whether you're gearing up for an interview or simply enjoy exploring data structures and algorithms, I hope this compilation serves as a valuable resource.

## Getting Started

1. `root`

-  Explore `collections.js` for essential data structures, accessible at collectionsjs.com.
-  Write and test your code in `index.js`.
-  If using LiveServer with VSCode, leverage `index.html` for interactive browser-based output display. (Optional for Node.js users.)
-  Consider using `template.js` as a guide for structuring your solutions.

2. Challenges

-  Navigate through subfolders containing diverse coding challenges, each accompanied by problem statements and examples.
-  Attempt the challenges in index.js before referring to my solutions.

Wishing you the best of luck on your coding journey!
